Intended to aid with Speedrun practice. Can modify *most* values present in the Savegame.

The Game needs to be restarted to load a modified Savegame or Settings. Autosaving ingame will override all Slots in the Savegame.

## Features

- Set Save-Slot values
  - Level-Progress, Lives, etc
- Change Options
  - Language, Volume, etc
- Enable Cheats

## Warnings

- Windows only
- only tested on Windows 10 (2004) x64
- still no darkmode! ðŸ˜ž
- all IO actions will block the GUI, so it may hang a bit if you store your files on a floppy

## Code

- written in/with C++ 17
- uses cmake (find_package / find_path)
- C++ rewrite mostly intended as an exercise, thus somewhat over engineered compared to the previous AutoIT version
- previous AutoIT version can be found in au3 branch
